        Daily: 2024/09/09


    You are given two integers m and n, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

    You are also given the head of a linked list of integers.

    Generate an m x n matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise),
    starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with -1.

    Return the generated matrix.


    Example 1:

        Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1, 7, 9, 4, 2, 5, 5, 0]

        Output: [[3, 0, 2, 6, 8], [5, 0, -1, -1, 1], [5, 2, 4, 9, 7]]

        Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
            Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.

    Example 2:

        Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0, 1, 2]

        Output: [[0, 1, 2, -1]]

        Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
            The last space in the matrix is set to -1.


    Constraints:

        1 <= m, n <= 10^5
        1 <= m * n <= 10^5
        The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, m * n].
        0 <= Node.val <= 1000
